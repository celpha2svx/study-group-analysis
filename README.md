📊 Study Group Analysis: Impact on Exam Performance

🧠 Introduction
This project investigates how study group participation and attendance influence student exam scores. Using a dataset of 50 students, we apply statistical methods to uncover patterns and build predictive models.

📁 Dataset Overview
- 50 students
- Columns: Name, Age, ExamScore, Attendance, StudyGroup
- StudyGroup encoded as binary (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

🔍 Methodology
- Encoding categorical variables
- Descriptive statistics
- Confidence interval estimation
- Hypothesis testing (t-test)
- Correlation analysis
- Regression modeling

📈 Key Findings
- Students in study groups scored significantly higher (p ≈ 1.4e-13)
- Attendance is a strong predictor of performance (R² = 0.939)
- Age has no meaningful impact on scores

✅ Conclusion
Study group participation and consistent attendance are powerful drivers of academic success. These insights can inform student support programs and intervention strategies.

🚀 Next Steps
- Explore time-based trends (e.g., weekly attendance)
- Add more predictors (e.g., study hours, prior GPA)
- Build a predictive dashboard
